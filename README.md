## 📂 Data & Tools Used

- **Google Sheets**  
- **Excel**  
- **Pivot Tables**  
- **Formula-based KPI calculations**

### KPIs Calculated:

- **CPM (Cost Per Mille)**  
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**  
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**

## 📈 Analysis Steps

1. Imported and cleaned SEA campaign data in Excel & Google Sheets  
2. Built pivot tables to aggregate:
   - Impressions  
   - Clicks  
   - Costs  
   - Turnover  
3. Calculated KPIs for each channel and campaign  
4. Compared performance across SEA Text, DSA, Branded, Generic, and Paid Other  
5. Visualized performance results for better decision-making

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Top-performing campaigns:**  
  SEA **DSA** and **Branded** campaigns delivered the **highest ROAS** and best efficiency.

- **Most cost-effective campaigns:**  
  SEA Branded campaigns showed the best CPC and CAC values.

- **Underperforming / Overspending channels:**  
  SEA Text and Paid Other channels consumed budget while delivering weak ROI.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Shift more budget into **Branded + DSA**, and reevaluate the efficiency of Text campaigns and Paid Other.
