# SEA Campaign Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis of SEA campaigns for marketing performance at Greenweez. Key KPIs analyzed include **CTR, CPC, CPM, CAC, and ROAS**, calculated using Excel and Google Sheets.

The analysis identified that **SEA – DSA and SEA branded campaigns** deliver the highest ROI, while **SEA Text and Paid Other channels** are overspending with low returns, highlighting opportunities to optimize budget allocation and maximize revenue.
