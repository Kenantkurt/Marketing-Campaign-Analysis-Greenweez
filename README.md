# SEA Campaign Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis of SEA campaigns for marketing performance at Greenweez, focusing on optimizing marketing spend and ROI.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to evaluate the performance of different marketing channels, with a particular focus on **SEA campaigns**, by calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) and identifying the most cost-effective campaigns.

## Data & Tools
- **Data Sources:** Google Sheets and Excel files with campaign performance data
- **Key Metrics Calculated:**  
  - **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** – % of impressions that resulted in clicks  
  - **CPC (Cost Per Click)** – Cost per single click  
  - **CPM (Cost Per Mille)** – Cost per 1,000 impressions  
  - **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** – Cost to acquire one customer  
  - **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** – Revenue generated per unit of ad spend

## Analysis Steps
1. Imported and cleaned campaign data in Google Sheets and Excel  
2. Used pivot tables to summarize costs, clicks, impressions, and turnover by channel and campaign  
3. Calculated KPIs (CTR, CPC, CPM, CAC, ROAS) for each campaign and channel  
4. Compared campaigns to identify high ROI and low-performing campaigns  
5. Visualized key metrics for better understanding and decision-making

## Key Findings
- **Top Performing Campaigns:** SEA – DSA and SEA branded campaigns deliver the highest ROI  
- **Most Cost-Effective Campaigns:** SEA branded campaigns  
- **Overspending Channels:** SEA Text campaigns and Paid Other channels are underperforming relative to their spend  
- **Recommendation:** Focus budget on high-performing SEA campaigns and review low-performing channels for optimization
